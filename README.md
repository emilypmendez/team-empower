# [Team Empower: NYC Community Boards Dashboard Prototype](https://team-empower.netlify.app)

**[About Team Empower](https://github.com/emilypmendez/team-empower/blob/main/README.md)**

Team Empower Prototype is a dashboard web application designed to be beautiful and simple. It is built on top of [React Bootstrap](https://5c507d49471426000887a6a7--react-bootstrap.netlify.com/), using [Light Bootstrap Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/light-bootstrap?ref=lbdr-readme) and it is fully responsive.

The product represents a small suite of tools based on data science that can help users identify the ongoings of community boards 4 and 14 in Brooklyn, New York USA. We have created it thinking about things you actually need to see in a dashboard. This product contains multiple handpicked and optimized data resources. Everything is designed to fit with one another. As you will be able to see, the dashboard you can access is a customization of this product.

**[About Community Boards](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cau/community-boards/about-commmunity-boards.page)**
Community Districts are the smallest level of government in NYC and act as a bridge between local communities and the broader city-wide efforts. This project aims to work with the leaders of those communities to empower their districts using data science. Our team will be working with District Manager, Brooklyn Community Board 4 and District Manager, Brooklyn Community Board 14 to uplift their respective districts. Some of our solutions include an interactive tool for land use applications, an interactive dashboard for local budgeting and a mapping tool to determine community needs.
